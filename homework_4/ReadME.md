Explain how web browsers function
There are basics to the web browers function, placing an  input (URL) to a specific website, which places are request in to the 
server in which the site is stored. 
In return you get a response which includes HTML, CSS and JS. which control the content, style and interactivity. 
These basics control what appears on the site, for display, how things function and work as you use the website and how it
continues to run properly. 

Define and describe DOM
(if correct) its similar to a middle man for when loading up a webpage. When placing in a request to go to a webpage
the site has to be read first, in which there DOM comes into play, to read, sort and organize the HTML information
before it gets to you. 

What is the difference between HTML XML and XHTML? 
HTML and XHTML are very similar but XHTML has a much bigger demand for standards to function properly
and often takes much more time to takes more time to create due to its demand for percise writing. 
This also means unlike HTML which can change and update often/regularly XHTML is less likely to be changed as so often
due to the standards, but this also makes it easier to maintain. 

What are the 4 elements your HTML pages need? 
A decleration Doctype, followed by the Root, Head, and Body

What is the index.html page for? Where does it go? 
an Index.html is a entery point for laoding a website, when a site is loaded
it automatically looks for the Index.html for information.
(if i understand correctly it acts kind of like a file source?
It holds the rest of the code and information for the website to load up?) 

Review: What are some of the best naming practices?
orginzation is key to keeping things properly in order. Naming the files properly are key to helping keep things sorted 
and making it easier to find and use certain things. Be it the code, photos or scripts. etc
When naming files and ifnromation its best to avoid using anything overly done and fancy, such as no spaces, no special characters
and using simple and basic (_,-) instead.
